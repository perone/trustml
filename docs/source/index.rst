trustml documentation
===================================
trustml is a framework created to bring trust and transparency to machine learning code and models.
trustml provides an easy-to-use framework to sign and verify machine learning models and code for companies
and open-source developers. Built on top of sigstore, trustml uses a public and verifiable log of records 
where anyone can see and verify signatures and verify provenance of artifacts. This means that anyone can
easily guarantee that the models are coming from where they it claims to be, bringing accountability and
protection to users and providers.
